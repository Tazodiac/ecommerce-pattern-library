    typefaces.secondary: |
      Cubano was selected as the secondary font because it is part of the brands logo design. It gives nice bold letters with rounded edges for a softness.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colours are oranges because it is the most common colour on snakes. If not a direct bright orange then different hues and saturations of oranges. One of the most sought after morphs in the snake communities tend to be bright oranges.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colours are blues because it is a complimentary colour to orange. It can also add a more inviting and calming tone to the bright vibrances of orange.
